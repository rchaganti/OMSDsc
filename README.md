# OMSDsc #
PowerShell Desired State Configuration resource module for managing Microsoft Operations Management Suite service configuration on Windows Endpoints.

Microsoft OMS includes the following four offerings:
- [Insight & Analytics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/cloud-platform/insight-and-analytics)
- [Automation & Control](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/cloud-platform/automation-and-control) 
- [Protection & Recovery](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/cloud-platform/protection-and-recovery)
- [Security & Compliance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/cloud-platform/security-and-compliance)

These offerings in Microsoft OMS enable hybrid cloud management and extend Azure services such as data protection and disaster recovery, Azure Automation Runbooks and DSC, and Log & event collection and analysis.

This soon-to-be-released PowerShell DSC resource module includes resource modules that enable automated configuration on-prem integration with OMS.

Here is an [RFC](https://github.com/rchaganti/OMSDsc/blob/master/RFC/RFC0001-ResourceNaming.md) (Request For Comments) that I just opened to gather some suggestions and ideas around naming of the resources in this module. 

Make a note that the module name itself may change based on feedback and it need not be OMSDsc.

Go ahead and add your suggestions/feedback here.
